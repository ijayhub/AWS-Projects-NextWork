Recently, I felt an urge to learn about cloud computing, so I decided to explore AWS. The reason I chose AWS? Itâ€™s known to be beginner-friendly and one of the biggest cloud providers out there. Honestly, I just wanted to try something new. I began my journey with [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/users/sign_in?redirect=http%3A%2F%2Fapp.datacamp.com%2Fcertification) but soon pivoted to exploring resources directly on the [AWS website](https://explore.skillbuilder.aws/learn).

After completing my learning, I needed a place to practice what I had learned. So, I decided to write an article. However, even after writing it, I still didnâ€™t feel satisfied.
Feel free to read it and let me know what you think! : [What is cloud computing? A Guide for Beginners ](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/cloud-computing-guide-for-beginners/) 

Finally, I found a community where I could practice my skills.
[NextWork](https://community.nextwork.org/c/all-aws-projects?post_login_redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fcommunity.nextwork.org%2F). 
The community is welcoming and well organized. So far, things are going great! Iâ€™m improving and getting more comfortable with AWS services, which initially felt overwhelming.
The community is organised by [Natasha Ong](https://www.linkedin.com/in/natasha-ong/) and other great people.

I didnâ€™t document my progress, my bad, but the project was about hosting a website on Amazon S3!
